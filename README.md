# Sanken-Sales-Performance-Analysis

## Project Background
Sanken, an Indonesian company established in 1996, specializes in selling a variety of electrical appliances. I'm partnering with the Data Scientist to extract insights and deliver recommendations to improve performance across sales, product and marketing teams.

## Executive Summary
Sanken's sales analysis of 17k records across 2016-2020 shows an average around Rp. 18 billion each year, with the province of Jakarta and Banten contributing 71% of sales. Refrigerator and Washing Machine account for 72% of sales. Sanken can benefit from expanding top product lines and optimizing bundling to increase customer lifetime value. Targeted growth in DKI Jakarta and Banten province, will reinforce Sanken's market position and drive sustainable growth.

- Refrigerator products consistently lead in orders count by 35% and revenue by 42% from 2016 to 2020.
- Refrigerator and Washing Machine categories experienced remarkable growth with increases of 173% and 214% respectively in 2017.
- The Rice Cooker’s order count of 11% is nearly double of its revenue share of 6%, likely due to its low price or frequent inclusion in bundles or promotions, resulting in high sales volume but lower revenue contribution.

### Customer Growth and Repeat Purchase Trends
- Unique customers increased significantly by 135% in 2017.
- The repeat rate (≥2 orders) gradually decreases from 93% in 2016 to 78% in 2018, indicating challenges in retaining customers after their initial purchases, increases again to 90% in 2019, suggesting that retention efforts were improved or more customers made repeat purchases during that period.
